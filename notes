Inheritance

Private
- only accessible from an instance of a class only
Protected
- only accessible from an instance of a class 
  or an instance of a child class
Public 
- accessible from anywhere

To inherit, we have to write public. 
1. Can also write protected and private- encaptulation level of inheritance
2. Multiple inheritance- Diamond heritage
	- virtual- inherit from one base class
		instead of 2 

using
- using directive: bring all namespace members into current scope
- using declaration: bring a member from base class to current class's scope

Adhoc Polymorphism 多态性/ function overloading 
- function has the same name but different parameters

-wshadow 
-Wno-shadow 
	- used to control the warnings related to variable shadowing
	- occurs when a variable declared within a block has the same name 


can do
ex01- add virtual when there is inheritance- virtual destructor, virtual attack function
add wshadow in makefile
ex03- add virtual to attack function for ClapTrap-
	-otherwise it will shadow the attack function
	- use static class variable to the default value
